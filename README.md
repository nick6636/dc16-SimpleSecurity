# Project Description
Simple Security is an internet of things implementation that allows you to control
appliances connected to RF outlets from anywhere by connecting to a web server being hosted 
by a Raspberry Pi. Simple Security also notifies the user of a door sensor being triggered
and provides a live stream from a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi.

# Progress (Week 03/29)
Implemented an initial frontend/backend combination that provides a simplistic interface 
for turning on a single remote outlet, but not turn it off. The next step for this part of the project
is to implement the rest of the channels of the outlets nad to create a better looking UI.
